    <img src="Pizza_Margherita_stu_spivack.jpg"
    <h4><p>While the name Pizza Margherita may have been popularized because of the Queen's visit, a pizza made with the same toppings was already present in Naples between 1796 and 1810.</p>
        <p>In 1830, in the book Napoli, contorni e dintorni, written by Riccio, it was described as a pizza with tomato, mozzarella and basil.</p>
